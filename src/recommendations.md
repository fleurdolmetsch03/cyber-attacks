<div style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-top: 40px;">
    We enable our users to identify the most harmful attack types and sources for their respective target countries and industries. For each attack type and source, we suggest specific measures to prevent such attacks from happening. Additionally, we recommend the defence mechanism with the lowest average resolution time for the identified attack type, as this is the most effective way to quickly dissolve the attack.
